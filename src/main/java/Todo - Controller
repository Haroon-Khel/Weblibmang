To Do:

A class that takes in the request parameters: User, Password and Acc.
Searches mongodb for an entry in the Users collection for a document verifying all 3 conditions
	simultaneously. Else a null is returned and user is redirected back to home page, with text
	under fields reading something along the lines of "invalid user/pass"
